## Thoughts on Go

### Things I Like
- cli tools
- syntactic sugar
- compile time style/lint checks
- vim-go save time compile check
- always copy by value
- good balance of defined interfaces and ducktyping
- defer
- go fmt
- no exceptions (or at least uncommon exceptions)
  - you basically just have error "codes"
- first class functions!!!

### Things I Dislike
- double quotes
- capitals
- not as implicit and convenient as ruby
- GOPATH
- uppercase functions for public; would prefer public/private or underscore
- no implicit truthy for boolean expressions
- `interface {}` is a weird generic
  - Casting from `interface {}` is a method call..?
